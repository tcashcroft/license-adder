Skills Evaluation:

Write code, in the language of your choice, that using the github API, goes through all the public and private github repos in a github organization and checks if they have a license.  (You can create a free github.com organization to test with here.)
Write code that if the license is missing, opens a pull request which adds a license. (More info about licenses can be found here: https://choosealicense.com/)
Save your code (finished or not) into a public github repo.
Document any assumptions you made, instructions on how to run your code and anything else you want me to know using a README.md file in the root of the directory tree in the repo.
Reply to this email giving me the link to the repo with your code at or before Wednesday, October 10, 2018. If you don't finish all of the requirements on time please send the link by the deadline anyway.
We give preference to submissions in go/python/kotlinâ€‹/typescript/nodejs but outstanding submissions in any language with a strong willingness to learn new technologies will be seriously considered.

 

If you haven't dealt with web service APIs, github or AWS before there is publicly available and easily found (via google) documentation on each technology/product required for the evaluation.

 

Best regards and happy coding!
